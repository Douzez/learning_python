Solve the sudoku problem
This is a backtracking problem, so use recursion to solve this problem.
The key is to fill out theboar and use it as a partial solution.

Base case:
    * Using find_zero function find the first empty cell. If there are no more 0's on the board
    the board is solved and you are done.
Recursive case:
    * If there is an empty cell (0) check if you can put a value (1-9, but start with 1) on there.
    * Check if it's a valid placement by using is_valid function.
        - if it's not a valid placement, try the next number and do this all over again.
        - If it is a valid placement, assign it to that value.
        Â· Recurse by solving the updated board () since you assign a cell a new value)
            - if there is a solution return that solution
            - If there is not a solution, assign that cell back to 0 to backtrack and
            do this all over again with the next number.
    * The output should be a list of lists of the board but without 0s and completely filled out with numbers.
        Note. 
    * If there's no solution return None.
